# Hacktober Fest 2021
🙅🏼‍♂️Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community. Whether you’re new to development, a student, long-time contributor, event host, or company of any size, you can help drive growth of open source and make positive contributions to an ever-growing community. All backgrounds and skills levels are encouraged to complete the challenge.🙅🏼‍♂️
## Instructions for beginners: 🙅🏼 🙅🏼‍♂️
- If you are totally new to this culture then head over to this [guide](beginner_guidelines.md) where everything has been explained!
- After you are done untill Step:2 (setting up a branch), then you can make pull request without being assigned an issue. The PR should follow the rules mentioned in the end of these instructions.
- You can create programs for any language we have folder of. Make sure the code is understandable.
- If you really want to contribute to a specific issue and you are familiar with this method, then find issues marked as beginner or create new one issue. Do not make pull request untill assigned!

## Instructions for intermediates: 🙅🏼 🙅🏼‍♂️
- I expect you are familiar with concept of forking and creating a branch in your forked repo. If you still find it difficult, then head over to this [guide](intermediate_guidelines.md).
- Look at the current issues.
- If you are interested in any of them then comment "I would like to contribute in this"
- Issues are assigned on first-come basis.
- If you want to work on anything you have in mind then create an issue for that, tag me and then wait for it be to be assigned to you. 
- Do not make Pull request untill you are assigned that specific issue.

## Code I expect (for everyone):
- It should be properly formatted
- Add relevant comments explaining what the code is all about.
- Please use proper naming for variables, do not use i,j,k,x,y,z. The variable name should be self explanatory.
- Use proper names for your files.
- Do all your changes in your forked repository branch and not in master branch untill asked.
- I will reject any pull request which looks like spammy or just to have +1 in the counter, so contribute quality code here!

## 👑 👑 Hurray!!! You just got closer to completing your hacktoberfest challenge. 😃
